Augmented Reality web application that simulates tattoo designs uploaded by tattoo artists, written with ar.js to display transparent png designs with the use of a customized 'marker' that is printed. User can hold or place the marker on their skin to simulate a tattoo from a collection of tattoos. Under each tattoo design is a link to the artist's page who uploaded the art piece. This application helps artists to display their art and users to have fun with the idea of a tattoo!
